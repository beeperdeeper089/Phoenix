	 * @brief Acts as a universal pairing between string and block.
	 *
	 * This class is a universal struct that can be passed around to act as a minimal set of data.
	 *
	 * Originally we had a BlockRegistry that was on the Client/Server but we
	 * realised that things like the Server don't need to store data about
	 * textures and the likes, so by only having this as a common piece between
	 * the two, the Client and Server can store extra data that they actually
	 * need and potentially reduce unnecessary memory usage.
	 *
	 * Each application implements their own BlockRegistry with a few more
	 * pieces of data and lua registration methods.
