	 *			bar is in the DrawBox - if the box is not drawn there will be no
	 *			input box and no dark tint.
	 *
	 *		InvsibibleMessage = the messages shown when you don't have the chat
	 *			open. No background, just straight up text shown above whatever is
	 *			being rendered. Shown when the DrawBox is not being... drawn.
	 *
	 * This class holds chat messages (and history) for the client, and renders
	 * said history.
	 *
	 * @todo Implement way of pushing messages even when network doesn't exist.
	 *		Potentially have another BlockingQueue in that scenario and pass that
	 *		between something like the commander and ChatBox.
