	 * @brief Base Camera class following basic FPS Cam principles.
	 *
	 * The camera functions as a basic tool for moving around in a 3D
	 * rendered world. This uses the "tick" function on every iteration of
	 * the main game loop to determine movement from the user.
	 *
	 * The camera moves in the direction the player is facing, this will
	 * change as more of the game is developed.
	 *
	 * @paragraph Usage
	 * @code
	 * FPSCamera* camera = new Camera(window);
	 *
	 * // this is pure theoretical, this code would not work ever...
	 * if (windowFocusLost) camera->enable(false);
	 * if (windowFocusGained) camera->enable(true);
	 * if (escapeKeyPressed) camera-<enable(!camera->isEnabled());
	 *
	 * void mainGameLoop()
	 * {
	 *     camera->tick(timeToRenderLastFrame);
	 *
	 *     shader.setProjection(camera->getProjection());
	 *     shader.setViewMatrix(camera->calculateViewMatrix());
	 *
	 *     world.render();
	 * }

		 * the amount the mouse has moved from the centre of the screen and
		 * will warp the mouse TO THE CENTRE of the window. This is
		 * important as you MUST disable the camera through
		 * ``camera->enable(false)``, otherwise you will not be able to move
		 * the mouse from the centre of the screen even if alt-tabbed out.
		 *
		 * The delta time is necessary since you want to be able to move the
		 * same amount whether you have higher frames or lower frames.
